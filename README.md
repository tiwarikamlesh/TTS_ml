# Tacotron 2 WAV File Renamer

A simple Python script to batch rename WAV files in a folder numerically, specifically designed to facilitate the management and organization of audio files generated by the Tacotron 2 text-to-speech system.

## Features

- Automatically detects WAV files in a specified folder
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase file extensions (e.g., `.WAV` and `.wav`)
- Renames files sequentially with a numerical prefix (e.g., `1.wav`, `2.wav`, etc.)

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Update the `folder_path` variable in `batch_rename_wav.py` to point to the directory containing your WAV files.
3. Run `batch_rename_wav.py` using Python 3.x:

python batch_rename_wav.py

4. The script will display the detected files and rename them sequentially in the specified folder.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x



# Tacotron2-Wav2Vec-Transcription

A Python script that uses the Wav2Vec2 model to transcribe .wav files and generates a .txt file for training a Tacotron2 text-to-speech model.

## Overview

This script transcribes audio files in the WAV format using the Wav2Vec2 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. It processes each WAV file, generates its corresponding transcription, and saves the transcription along with the file path in a .txt file. This .txt file can then be used for training a Tacotron2 text-to-speech model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- torchaudio
- transformers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tacotron2-Wav2Vec-Transcription.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required packages:

pip install torch torchaudio transformers

Copy code

## Usage

1. Modify the `transcribe_wav2vec.py` script to set the appropriate input and output paths.

2. Run the script:

python transcribe_wav2vec.py

csharp
Copy code

## Output

The output .txt file contains one line per transcribed WAV file, with the file path followed by a pipe character `|` and the transcription. The format is as follows:

/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/1.wav|transcription of the first file
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/2.wav|transcription of the second file
...
/content/TTS-TT2/wavs/n.wav|transcription of the nth file

# Tacotron 2 Audio Preprocessor

This repository contains a Python script (`tacotron2_preprocessor.py`) that preprocesses audio files for training a Tacotron 2 text-to-speech model. The script trims silence, normalizes the audio, and saves the processed files to a specified output folder. It's specifically designed to work with .wav files to help create a clean and consistent dataset for Tacotron 2 model training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Librosa
- SoundFile

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tacotron2-audio-preprocessor.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required libraries:

pip install librosa soundfile

r
Copy code

## Usage

1. Update the `input_path` and `output_path` variables in the `tacotron2_preprocessor.py` script to point to your input folder containing the .wav files and the desired output folder for the processed files.

```python
input_path = "path\\to\\your\\input_folder"
output_path = "path\\to\\your\\output_folder"
Run the tacotron2_preprocessor.py script:
Copy code
python tacotron2_preprocessor.py
ruby

# Audio Metadata Updater

This Python script updates the metadata of WAV audio files, specifically the "Title" and "Track Number" fields, to match their file names (without the file extension). The updated files are saved in a separate output folder, preserving the original files in the input folder. This can be particularly useful for managing large collections of audio files, ensuring consistency in their metadata.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x
- `taglib` library

## Installation

To install the `taglib` library, run the following command:

pip install python-taglib

r
Copy code

## Usage

1. Download the `audio_metadata_updater.py` script from this repository.
2. Modify the `input_folder` and `output_folder` variables in the script to match the desired source and destination folders for your audio files. For example:

```python
input_folder = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\input\\folder"
output_folder = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\output\\folder"
Run the script using the following command:
Copy code
python audio_metadata_updater.py
The script will process the WAV files in the input_folder, update their metadata, and save the updated files in the output_folder. The original files in the input_folder will remain unchanged.
Notes
This script is designed to work with WAV files only. Other audio formats may not be compatible.
Ensure you have read and write permissions for both the input_folder and output_folder.
The script assumes that the file names are in the format "1.wav", "2.wav", etc., and will update the metadata accordingly. If your files are named differently, you may need to modify the script to suit your specific naming convention.
